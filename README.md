**A responsive credit card form built with HTML5, Bootstrap, and CSS.**

## Project Summary

This project is a streamlined credit card form designed to collect payment information with a clean, user-friendly interface. Key aspects include:

- A form layout with fields for cardholder name, card number, expiration date, and CVV.
- Bootstrap-powered styling for a modern, responsive design.
- Client-side validation to ensure proper input formats.
- A visually appealing UI with consistent typography and spacing.

## Key Features

- **Form Inputs**: Fields for cardholder name, card number (16 digits), expiration date (MM/YY), and CVV (3-4 digits), styled with Bootstrap’s form controls for uniformity.
- **Input Validation**: Basic client-side validation ensures required fields are filled, card numbers are numeric and 16 digits, expiration dates follow the MM/YY format, and CVV is 3-4 digits.
- **Responsive Design**: Leverages Bootstrap 5.3 to ensure the form is mobile-friendly, with adjustments for smaller screens to maintain usability in both portrait and landscape modes.
- **Styling Consistency**: Uses Bootstrap utilities for spacing, typography, and button styles, with custom CSS for fine-tuned adjustments like input border radius and hover effects.
- **Error Feedback**: Displays error messages below fields when validation fails (e.g., "Invalid card number" if non-numeric characters are entered).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For semantic form structure.
- **CSS3**: Custom styling to enhance Bootstrap’s defaults, including input focus states and error message styling.
- **Bootstrap 5.3**: Provides responsive layout, form controls, and utilities for buttons, spacing, and typography.
